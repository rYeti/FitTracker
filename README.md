# FitTracker

FitTracker is a Flutter mobile application designed to help users track their nutrition, gym progress, and overall fitness journey.  
The app combines barcode-based food calorie tracking, workout logging, and a planned trainer–client system for personalized coaching and progress tracking.

## Features

### Nutrition Tracking
- Scan food products using barcodes.  
- Automatically fetch nutritional information (calories, protein, fats, carbohydrates, etc.).  
- Categorize and save foods under breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  
- View total daily calorie and macronutrient intake.

### Workout Tracking
- Log exercises with sets, repetitions, and weights.  
- Track progress for each exercise over time.  
- Create and schedule workouts using a calendar-based date picker.  
- Visualize performance trends (upcoming feature).

### Trainer–Client System (Upcoming)
- Trainers can create custom workout and meal plans for their clients.  
- Clients can track progress and communicate with their trainer.  
- Shared dashboard for performance monitoring.

### Future Features
- Gamification (badges, levels, and streaks).  
- Integration with wearable fitness devices.  
- Cloud synchronization for multi-device access.
